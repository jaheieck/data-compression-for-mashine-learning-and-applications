# data-compression-for-mashine-learning-and-applications
This repository contains the codes for the paper "Data Compression for Machine Learning and Applications"


The 4 folders contain the following codes:

QMCpoints: All necessary functions and documents to construct digital nets based on the "Magic Point Shop"
QMCweights: All necessary functions to calculate the weights for quasi-Monte Carlo points
supercompress: The scripts, functions and results, which are used in section 3.1 Integration functions 
NN_application: The scripts, functions and results, which are used in section 3.2 Neural networks

Each script and function has a short description, what their purpose is.
